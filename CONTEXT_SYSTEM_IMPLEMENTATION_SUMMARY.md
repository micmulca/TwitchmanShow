# üß† **Sprint 5 Task 2: Context System Implementation - COMPLETED** ‚úÖ

## üìã **Task Overview**
**Duration**: 2 days  
**Status**: ‚úÖ **COMPLETED**  
**Goal**: Implement sophisticated context-aware behaviors and environmental interactions for characters

---

## üéØ **Deliverables Achieved**

### ‚úÖ **1. Environmental Modifiers for Need Decay**
- **Context-aware need interactions**: Needs now affect each other based on location and context
- **Location-based modifiers**: Different locations apply different need modification rates
- **Weather context integration**: Weather conditions modify how needs decay and recover
- **Time-based context**: Time of day affects need modification rates

### ‚úÖ **2. Seasonal Effects on Action Availability**
- **Spring bonuses**: Farming (+30%), outdoor activities (+20%), fishing (+10%)
- **Summer baseline**: Normal conditions for all activities
- **Autumn harvest**: Harvesting (+40%), indoor crafts (+20%), outdoor activities (-20%)
- **Winter restrictions**: Indoor crafts (+30%), outdoor activities (-50%), farming (-70%)

### ‚úÖ **3. Location-Specific Behaviors**
- **Workshop focus**: Achievement focus (+30%), social need reduction (-20%), energy efficiency (+20%)
- **Outdoor exploration**: Curiosity boost (+40%), energy drain (+10%), comfort sensitivity (+30%)
- **Home comfort**: Enhanced comfort and energy recovery
- **Kitchen interactions**: Hunger and thirst interact more strongly

### ‚úÖ **4. Context-Aware Need Interactions**
- **Need coupling**: Related needs affect each other based on location
- **Context modifiers**: Environmental factors multiply need changes
- **Behavioral triggers**: Context changes trigger behavior modifications
- **Pattern analysis**: System learns and adapts to character preferences

```gdscript
# New signals for context system
signal context_behavior_triggered(character_id, behavior_type, context)
signal seasonal_action_modifier(season, action_id, modifier)

# Context-aware need interaction modifiers
var need_interaction_modifiers: Dictionary = {
    "kitchen": {
        "hunger_thirst": 0.8,      # Hunger and thirst interact more strongly
        "comfort_energy": 1.2      # Comfort and energy boost each other
    },
    "bedroom": {
        "energy_sleep_quality": 1.5,  # Energy and sleep quality strongly linked
        "comfort_energy": 1.3         # Comfort enhances energy recovery
    }
}

# Enhanced seasonal effects with action availability
var seasons: Dictionary = {
    "spring": {
        "action_modifiers": {
            "farming": 1.3,           # Better farming in spring
            "outdoor_activities": 1.2, # Pleasant outdoor conditions
            "fishing": 1.1            # Fish are more active
        }
    }
}
```

### **Behavior Trigger System**
```gdscript
# Context-aware behavior triggers
var behavior_triggers: Dictionary = {
    "weather": {
        "rain": {
            "indoor_preference": 1.5,    # Prefer indoor activities
            "movement_speed": 0.7,       # Move slower in rain
            "social_need": 0.8           # Less social in bad weather
        }
    },
    "location": {
        "workshop": {
            "achievement_focus": 1.3,    # More focused on achievement
            "social_need": 0.8,          # Less social in workshop
            "energy_efficiency": 1.2     # More efficient energy use
        }
    }
}
```

### **Context History and Pattern Analysis**
```gdscript
# Context tracking for behavior analysis
var context_history: Array = []
var max_context_history: int = 100
var behavior_patterns: Dictionary = {}

func _analyze_behavior_patterns():
    # Simple pattern analysis - could be much more sophisticated
    var recent_contexts = context_history.slice(-10)  # Last 10 contexts
    
    # Count location preferences
    var location_counts = {}
    for context in recent_contexts:
        var loc = context.location
        location_counts[loc] = location_counts.get(loc, 0) + 1
    
    # Update behavior patterns
    behavior_patterns["location_preference"] = location_counts
```
