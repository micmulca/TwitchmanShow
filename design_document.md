# Project Vision
Build a stream-ready **autonomous world** in **Godot 4 (2D)**—think top-down Pokémon-style—with characters who perceive, plan, and **socially** interact (no combat for now) in a living environment. The simulation is **single-player or no-player**, with the "player" acting primarily as an observer. The player may optionally direct certain actions via console commands. **Conversations between characters will be dynamically generated by a local LLM (via LM Studio)**, informed by relationship status, mood, proximity, and other relevant state data. Conversations are scalable, allowing any number of nearby characters to join, leave, interrupt, or shift topics dynamically. Characters can develop memories, change moods, and adjust relationships based on conversational events. The sim remains deterministic and reacts to external events (later: Twitch chat, Streamlabs) via a simple message bridge. The design is **data-driven** (actions/affordances in JSON), **component-based**, and **planner-pluggable** (Utility AI first, GOAP/BT swappable).
