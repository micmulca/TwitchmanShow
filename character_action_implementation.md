## 🏗️ Technical Architecture

### Component Structure
```
StatusComponent (replaces NeedsComponent)
├── NeedManager (tracks all need types)
├── PersonalityModifier (applies traits)
├── NeedInteraction (handles conflicts)
└── NeedVisualizer (debug display)

ActionPlanner
├── NeedAnalyzer (identifies priorities)
├── ActionScorer (calculates best actions)
├── ConflictResolver (handles competing needs)
└── ActionSelector (chooses optimal action)

EnvironmentalSensor
├── LocationDetector (current position)
├── WeatherMonitor (environmental conditions)
├── TimeManager (circadian rhythms)
└── ResourceDetector (available actions)

CharacterManager
├── DataLoader (JSON loading)
├── PersistenceManager (save/load)
├── TemplateSystem (character creation)
└── CharacterRegistry (active characters)
```

### Data Flow
1. **StatusComponent** updates needs based on time and actions
2. **EnvironmentalSensor** provides context and modifiers
3. **ActionPlanner** analyzes needs and scores available actions
4. **ActionExecutor** performs selected actions and updates needs
5. **CharacterManager** persists changes and manages state

### Performance Considerations
- **Update Batching**: Group need updates to reduce processing
- **LOD System**: Update frequency based on character importance
- **Caching**: Cache action scores and need calculations
- **Async Processing**: Background need updates for non-critical characters

## 🧪 Testing Strategy

### Unit Tests
- Need decay and recovery
- Action scoring algorithms
- Personality modifier calculations
- Environmental effect application

### Integration Tests
- Character creation and loading
- Action execution flow
- Need interaction handling
- System integration points

### Performance Tests
- Need update performance
- Action planning speed
- Memory usage
- Update frequency limits

### User Acceptance Tests

- ✅ Action planning produces realistic behaviors
- ✅ Environmental effects properly applied
- ✅ Character persistence works reliably

### Performance Metrics
- ✅ Need updates complete within 16ms (60 FPS)

## 🚨 Risk Mitigation

### Technical Risks
- **Performance Issues**: Implement LOD system and update batching
- **Memory Leaks**: Regular memory profiling and cleanup
- **Complexity Overload**: Modular design with clear interfaces

### Integration Risks
- **System Conflicts**: Gradual migration from NeedsComponent
- **Data Loss**: Robust save/load with validation
- **Performance Impact**: Incremental integration with monitoring

### Timeline Risks
- **Scope Creep**: Strict sprint boundaries and feature freeze
- **Technical Debt**: Regular refactoring and code review
- **Testing Delays**: Automated testing and continuous integration
