conversation topic <group_id> <topic> # Change conversation topic
conversation force <group_id> <npc>   # Force NPC to speak
conversation stats <group_id>         # Show conversation statistics
```

### Context Building
```bash
context build <npc> [targets...]      # Build context for NPC
context prompt <npc> [targets...]     # Build enhanced prompt for NPC
context validate <npc> [targets...]   # Validate context for NPC
```

### Streaming Management
```bash
streaming status                       # Show streaming status
streaming test <npc> <group_id>       # Test streaming dialogue generation
streaming force <npc> <group_id>      # Force streaming dialogue generation
```

## Testing

### Test Script
The `test_phase3_conversation.gd` script provides comprehensive testing of all Phase 3 features:

1. **Enhanced Context System Testing**: Tests context building, validation, and prompt generation
2. **Conversation System Testing**: Tests conversation creation, management, and statistics
3. **Streaming Integration Testing**: Tests streaming dialogue generation and status monitoring
4. **Agent Integration Testing**: Tests agent-aware topic management and turn management

### Manual Testing
Use the console commands above to test individual features:

```bash
# Start a conversation
conversation start agatha_barrow anya_carden community_news

# Check status
conversation status

# Build context for an NPC
context build agatha_barrow anya_carden
